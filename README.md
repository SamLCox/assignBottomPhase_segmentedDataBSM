# assignBottomPhase_segmentedDataBSM
Codes/scripts for assigning bottom phases to summarised seal data from broken-stick models (split into 5 segments)

These scripts are intended to be used as a guide when assigning phases (descent, bottom and ascent) to seal data segmented into 5 via broken-stick models.

The thresholds used can be altered - which may be necessary for different species and age classes (the current scripts were written for juvenile southern elephant seals).
