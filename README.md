# assignBottomPhase_segmentedDataBSM

These codes/scripts are intended to be used as a guide when assigning phases (descent, bottom and ascent) to seal data segmented into 5 via broken-stick models.

The thresholds used can be altered - which may be necessary for different species and age classes (the current scripts were written for juvenile southern elephant seals).

Required packages are listed at the start of each code/script.  Codes and scripts were developed using Rstudio version 0.99.489 and R version 3.3.1.
